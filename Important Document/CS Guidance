Upstox Achievements :-

market-timing-service
=====================
usage :- 
1) if today is holiday or not -> exchange/segments open hai ke nhi
so , agar week days hai but aaj holiday hai , so job run hoti saari , file nhi milti , code fat ta, faltu ka load bhadhta server pr , so using mts , you can check whether exchange is open or not  
Impact :- like in my team .. 119 jobs were there , so if they dont check whether segment is open or not today , so much extra load from just 1 team on server , so there were such major 11 team in org .. so faultu ka so much extra load on server almost all team where using my service .. so this service helped in cost cuttting in the entire org .. by this org saved last year .. 

2) market open hai ke nhi via kafka events :-
earlier what used to happen , manually they set the market open timing like 9:15 to 15:30  market timing either in the central config DB or in application config in the server , so after that they need to restart the server .. so , somtimes what happen these market timing changes on indian festivals like diwali .. so this was manual labour .. that you have to change the value of market opening and closing timing accross so many service .. so when we introduced kafka event , manual intervention hatt gya .. so now , we used to receive market open and close event from exchange itself , we used to consume it via our 1 adapter and to this adapter all other service listens or consumes the event 

Learning :- HLD , LLD , Rest APIs with validations , kafka , Locust client for load testing to QA team , how to upload and download from Amazon s3

bod legacy service migration 
=============================
For frontend team , python mei ek job likhi thi jo old python bod_service se data fetch krta tha .. deprecate that and write that job using java and get source data from java code ..
Challanging :- 
1) The bod had a particular complex structure , like exchange , then segments , then assetToken , then expiry then instruments values in seperate line . Also old documentation was there but they followed diff naming convention , so figured it out with new datas what that fields are exactly .
2) Making Comparator - to compare the old bod_job to new_bod job and list out the diff in bw them

Learning :- how to remove legacy jobs how to think critically , Using Rest apis in service to comparison 

file-detl - spring batch
=========================
Learnt :- Spring batch and how to Use spring batch to make processing of file or jobs much faster with multiple threads , write many jobs .. Bod_V11 , Suspended , developed instrument-file-difference-job


market-data-admin-ui - FrontEnd 
====================
1) Developed a ui along with a teammate for monitor so many jobs and service running .. even though we have grafana , but it is not a one stop solution .. from there you can enable disable and run jobs and can check whether api is not working .. we have incorporated important fetch APIs and admin APIS in UI 

Service migration from ngav1 (EC2) to ngav2 (kubernetes)
========================================================
First checked the necessary configs needed like DockerFile and tested the service on UAT 
then do the Locust load test in QA env , made the locust client and handed it to QA team .
Example :- gtt-order-service , order-triggering-service

market-data-api-service and instrument-service
==============================================
Developed various Rest and Rpc APIs for dynamic and static data for CRUD operation for diff services .
Admin Proto is separate and Used JWT.io based on the group and role assigned to the user 
instrument-service-lib :-
Learning :- how to make library module so that they load the data in their service and dont call rpc and rest apis
will take .. artifact id , version and import in their service .. mostly used for static data which loads once in a day .. added kafka events here in case .. if job fails the other service get to know and download the s3 file in their services
